/**
 * Keeps photo timing in step with the route and the timing mode.
 *
 * A photo's `progress` is computed once, when it is added, using whichever
 * timing mode is active at that moment. Add the photos first and switch to
 * Constant Pace afterwards and a photo keeps its old, point-counted value: it
 * then appears well behind the place it was taken.
 *
 * The recalculation uses the anchor the placement already established: a
 * stable journey segment ID plus the distance from that segment's start. It
 * never looks the photo up on the route again, so out-and-back coordinates
 * remain unambiguous and reordering segments does not move the photo to a
 * different track. Older projects fall back to their journey-wide distance.
 *
 * The effect deliberately does not depend on the picture list it writes to,
 * only on route and timing mode, so one change means exactly one pass.
