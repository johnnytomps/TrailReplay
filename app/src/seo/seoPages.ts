    detailParagraphs: [
      'A camera that follows a marker has to answer every move the marker makes. On a mountain route that means every switchback, and on a compressed replay a switchback lasts a fraction of a second — so the picture shakes even though the route is simply turning.',
      'Placing keyframes inverts that. You decide where the camera sits at a handful of moments, and the motion in between is interpolated rather than reacted. The result is a shot that holds still when you want it to and moves when you asked it to.',
      'Keyframes are saved inside your .replay project file and are anchored to a point on the route rather than to a timestamp, so changing the clip length or reordering journey segments keeps every shot on the piece of route you framed it for.',
    ],
    faq: [
      { question: 'Do I need to place a keyframe for the whole route?', answer: 'No. With no keyframes the camera behaves like Follow Behind, and a single keyframe holds one locked-off shot for the entire replay. Add more only where you want the shot to change.' },
      { question: 'What happens between two keyframes?', answer: 'The camera eases from one to the next. You can also set a keyframe to hold the previous shot until it is reached, or to move at a constant rate instead of easing.' },
      { question: 'Can the camera keep pointing the same way as the route?', answer: 'Yes. Each keyframe is either locked to the compass or held relative to the route, so a shot can stay over-the-shoulder as the trail turns.' },
      { question: 'Does the exported video match the preview?', answer: 'Yes. The exported frames use the same camera evaluation as the live preview, so what you framed is what gets recorded.' },
      { question: 'My camera still moves more than I want. What should I change?', answer: 'Pull the Camera Stability slider toward Cinematic. It widens the window the camera smooths its path over. Pulling the camera further back also helps, because a wider shot can absorb more of the route wander.' },
