 *
 * The remedy is a ceiling on pitch rather than a correction after the fact.
 * Tilting is what lowers the camera, so a pitch limit stops the gesture at
 * the surface instead of letting it through and yanking it back — and a limit
 * that moves smoothly cannot produce the snap that a corrective jump would.
